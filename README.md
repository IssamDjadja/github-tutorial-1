## Git vs. GitHub

Git and Github may sound similar but there are a few differences where you can comprehend the concept of each.  

**_Git_** is a version control that consists of your basic workflow  

 * version control: a saved or 'snapshot' that keeps your code
  * so you can return to your original code if you made a mistake and want to fix it
 * no GITHUB needed for Git (2 separate devices)
 * simple commands - assists you; to save your code
 * initialize your git to begin working (git init)
  * look through workflow & commands!
  * adding files 
  * commiting your saved and added file (ability to seize and store your code)
 * a space for your command lines to run

**_GitHub_** is basically a website that people can view the work you have created. 
 
* must obtain git in order to proceed
 * explore through this website - github.com (or you can call it the cloud of the code)
* your code is stored within this website that you are presenting yourself by 
* repositories can be viewed, forked, and cloned 
 * look through workflow & commands for more information about forking and cloning

## Initial Setup

What is initial setup, you may ask. This is where you first begin to place your SSH key from the device you're using (nitrous, cloud 9, etc)
into Github so that viewers can see it live.

**Directions:** 

1. sign in with github and the local machine you are using
2. once signed in, continue on by clicking on settings on the dropdown menu with your profile icon
3. select "SSH keys" and press "add key"
4. name the key and copy and paste your SSH key into the large text box
  * similar to finding the previous steps; go to your local machine > settings > SSH Keys > copy and paste the default key
5. after you've added the key, you are able to run your code through github so that others can preview live of your workflow
